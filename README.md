# Django-Searcher
Using Django+Python+SQL Designed a web app to store a users current position with some information( Like name,E-mail,Date ) so that when other person needs help of some other region from that some area he can do search area wise and get details of person so that he can contact them

App contains previos apps also but the app being disscussed here is the "searcher" app.

It is good for the practice of implementing MTV feature of Django, forms features and some basic SQL queries so that anyone can get familiar with it.
